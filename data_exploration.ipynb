One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness.

    "### Implementation: Creating Clusters\n",
    "Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data — if any. However, we can quantify the \"goodness\" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Fit a clustering algorithm to the `reduced_data` and assign it to `clusterer`.\n",
    " - Predict the cluster for each data point in `reduced_data` using `clusterer.predict` and assign them to `preds`.\n",
    " - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to `centers`.\n",
    " - Predict the cluster for each sample data point in `pca_samples` and assign them `sample_preds`.\n",
    " - Import sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score and calculate the silhouette score of `reduced_data` against `preds`.\n",
    "   - Assign the silhouette score to `score` and print the result."
